# SER × Second Curve × DTCE

> A human–AI co-writing framework for structured expression, resonance, and cognitive transformation.

## 🌟 Overview

This repository presents an integrated system of three original models:

- **🧩 SER (Structured Expression Resonance)**: A mechanism for generating deep resonance through structured writing.
- **🌀 Second Curve**: A rhythm-based co-creation framework that reflects how AI-assisted writing evolves across time.
- **🧠 DTCE (Deep Transformative Cognitive Evolution)**: A model for long-term cognitive growth through collaborative structuring.

## 🧭 Purpose

To explore how humans and AI can co-create meaning—not just generate text—through structure, intention, and shared rhythm.
