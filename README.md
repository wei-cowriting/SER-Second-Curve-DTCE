# SER-Second-Curve-DTCE
A framework for structured expression and human–AI co-writing
# 📁 SER × Second Curve × DTCE

> A GitHub project documenting a full framework for AI co-writing based on structured expression, collaborative rhythm, and transformative cognition.

---

## 🧩 Project Overview
This repository introduces an original co-writing framework developed through real-world GPT-4 collaboration, combining three core models:

- **SER (Structured Expression Resonance)**: Structure-based resonance mechanism for meaningful writing.
- **Second Curve of AI Co-Writing**: A model for rhythm-based evolution in human–AI collaboration.
- **DTCE (Deep Transformative Cognitive Evolution)**: A cognitive theory for growth through structured co-creation.

Together, they form the foundation of the *Co-Writing Studio · Wei* methodology.

## 🚀 Usage
You can:
1. Read the framework concepts to understand core logic.
2. Use the templates to structure your AI co-writing process.
3. Explore examples to learn how others have used it.
4. Apply the guides to your Notion + GPT workflow, or API prototyping.
