# SER × Second Curve × DTCE

This repository documents a series of frameworks and real-world co-writing examples between AI and human collaborators.

- **Second Curve of AI Co-Writing**  
A rhythm-based model capturing human-AI thinking evolution.

- **DTCE (Deep Transformative Cognitive Evolution)**  
A theory of how structured co-creation drives cognitive growth.

## Examples
